        <p> I have recently started my journey as a Front-end developer four years ago. It has been a challenging, but to make small projects with 
            HTML, CSS, javaScript has given me a chance to show some of my knowledge and what I can do. I hope to continue, 
            this path. Learning different coding language and improving my skills to become a better developer. My goal is to continue to learn and 
            become a software engineer. I have worked with back-end programs, such as Node, and SQL.

                Hello my name is Courtney Re Lee and for the last 6 years I have enjoyed providing my professional

    <article class="hobby">
        <p>I was born and raised in Junction City Kansas, and currently reisde in my home town with my husband and two
            children.
            I enjoy reading novels, crafting, and playing with my children in my spare time. When I find out a
            show has been made from a novel I have read, I like to torture my husband and tell him all the missing
            parts of the show that the writers screwed up and/or got wrong.

        <p>
            Teaching has been a wonderful profession, I enjoy coming to work and teaching them about literature and
            helping them further thier education and sometimes helping them go into a career path or their choosing.
            Teaching has
            taught me to try and understand students and help them with not only education, but also with personal
            development. I
            enjoy talking and laughing with my students and I have personally learned that if I understand them they
            feel less
            distant in my classroom and want to engage in classroom activity.

    <p>
        My full name is Calvin Lee but I would prefer to be called CJ. I was born and raised in Junction City Kansas and besides a few years due to 
        work, I have been here a good portion of my life. I have been a mechanic for over a decade and even graduated with my associates degree in
        2009 from Manhattan area technical college. I decided to try coding when I realized that my current career was not the only thing that
        I wanted to do. I began to learn the different careers that came with my new knowledge of technology and my goal is to become a software 
        engineer. But with all the different types of careers that come with coding that means the possibilities are endless, and I am ALWAYS open
        to new career ideas.

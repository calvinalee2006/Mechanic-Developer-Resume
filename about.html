            </div>
            <p>
                I am a software Developer from Junction City, KS. I am an open-minded person who is willing to learn and grow as a person/worker.
            </p>
            <p>
                My full name is Calvin Lee but I would prefer to be called CJ. I was born and raised in Junction City Kansas and besides a few years due to 
                work, I have been here a good portion of my life. I have been a mechanic for over a decade and even graduated with my associates degree in
                2009 from Manhattan area technical college. I decided to try coding when I realized that my current career was not the only thing that
                I wanted to do. I began to learn the different careers that came with my new knowledge of technology and my goal is to become a software 
                engineer. But with all the different types of careers that come with coding that means the possibilities are endless, and I am ALWAYS open
                to new career ideas.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not turning wrenches or debugging my code, you can find me in the gym pushing weights or you can find me spending time with
                my family. My kids are adorable but they are something else to keep up with!
            </p>
